# LogiSheets Development

We are glad that you are interested in joining our development.

In this project, we are going to design the best spreadsheet application
and explore the best practice about Rust and Typescript application.

## Concept
`LogiSheets` is a Rust library, a web component or maybe in the future, a co-work supporting product.
We do not attemp to use more names to identify these concepts.
They all are `LogiSheets`.


## Code Management

All the `LogiSheets` related code is in this one repo.
You should have **Rust** and **yarn** installed.
Since we compile the **Rust** code into web assembly, you should have [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/commands/build.html) installed too.
