`gents` is a tool for generating **Typescript** interfaces from **Rust** code.
We can easily use `serde-json` to communicate between **Rust** and **Typescript**, 
without writing **Typescript** stubs trivially.
It is designed for [LogiSheets](https://github.com/proclml/LogiSheets) and
is inspired by [`ts-rs`](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/ts-rs). 

Your issues and PRS are welcome!

## Why we need `gents` but not `ts-rs`?

- `ts-rs` generates the files when running `cargo test` and in this way we must
commit those generated files into our repo.
It is not necessary and is even an obstacle when we use `bazel` as our building tool.
`gents` acts as a binary to generate **Typescript** files.

- `gents` introduces a concept *Group* that from all the members in 
this group files are generated will be placed in the same directory.

- Code generated by `ts-rs` is not match our coding style.

Many thanks to `ts-rs` because of its great job and it helps `gents` a lot.
